<p>For a customer I was tasked to demonstrate the capabilities of <a href="https://customvision.ai">Azureâ€™s CustomVision platform</a>. To help truly envision what the CustomVision platform can do, I proposed we should try to make the demonstration happen in â€˜real timeâ€™. Real time in this case means drawing the labels over the recognized objects within the timespan of seconds. In this blog post, I will demonstrate how simple it is to teach a CustomVision model to recognize different chess pieces.</p>

<p>As you can see in the video above, which I took using my phone, the CustomVision model can recognize most chess pieces easily. It does have some trouble with recognizing the differences between a pawn and a rook, which is understandable. These pieces are pretty similar, and Iâ€™ve only fed the model about 100 photoâ€™s yet.</p>

<p>On a technical level, what happens in this video is this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The phone takes a picture, using my <a href="https://github.com/drmanhatin/CustomVisionRealTime">CustomVision RealTime toolkit</a>. This toolkit is run in the browser, <strong>so no app required!</strong></li>
  <li>The picture is compressed, to save bandwidth, speed up the upload, and to ensure that the video does not exceed 4MB (max size for labeling in CustomVision)</li>
  <li>The picture is sent to the CustomVision API</li>
  <li>CustomVision returns the labels and the coordinates of where it has detected these labels</li>
  <li>The labels are drawn over the camera screen in the browser</li>
</ol>

<p>This process typically takes between 1 to 2 seconds, depending on the network speed, device speed and the size of the photo.</p>

<p>This is actually VERY simple and doesnâ€™t require ANY knowledge of programming or machine learning. It requires that you have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <a href="https://customvision.ai">CustomVision</a> account</li>
  <li>Photos of different chess pieces</li>
  <li>A brain</li>
</ol>
