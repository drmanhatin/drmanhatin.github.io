<p>For a customer I was tasked to demonstrate the capabilities of <a href="https://customvision.ai">Azureâ€™s CustomVision platform</a>. To help envision the possibilities, I proposed we should try to make the demonstration happen in â€˜real timeâ€™. Real time in this case means drawing the labels over the recognized objects within the timespan of seconds.</p>
